# PythonBlackjack
a very basic Python game. it functions, but can be improved

I've created the famous card game blackjack all in Python. This was a challenge to me as I am not entirely used to Classes in Python

As the "About" section suggests, this is a very simple interpretation. There isn't any exception handling and the security isn't

all that great. This wasn't about getting a sophisticated and thorough game to work, it was about learning how to implement Pything OOP and experience

how inheritance and Polymorphism can optimize code and improve functionality.
